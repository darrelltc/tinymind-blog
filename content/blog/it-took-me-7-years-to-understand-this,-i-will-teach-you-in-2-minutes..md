1. The less you say, the more your words will matter.

2. Don't take everything personally. Not everyone thinks about you, as much as yourself does.

3. When you focus on problems, you'll have more problems. When you focus on possibilities, you'll have more opportunities.

4. No matter how much it hurts now, someday you will look back and realize your struggle changed your life for the better.

5. There will always be a reason why you meet people. Either you need them to change your life or you're the one that will change theirs.

6. Never be afraid to try something new because life gets boring when you stay within the limits of what you already know.

7. The only person you have to face in the morning is yourself.
